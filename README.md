# OpenCV-BackgroundEditor
A good background removal is important for maintaining video quality in professional as
well as virtual environments. In this paper, we have created a background replacement
system by using a module called OpenCV, which is an open source computer vision
library. We achieve this by using different image processing techniques like background
subtraction, image differencing, thresholding,etc. This creates a user friendly solution for
background replacing without any fuss, also taking care of the performance.
